# device42-go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/QCU87Z/device42-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/QCU87Z/device42-go)

This is a project for accessing the Device42 APIs via a go cli interface.

The purpose of this project is to allow me grab information out of Device42 with out the need to use the web interface. 
As I prefer a keyboard centric workflow.
